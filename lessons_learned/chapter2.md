# Chapter 2

## Section 2.1

### Data abstraction

Data abstraction is a methodology that enables us to isolate how a *compound data object* is **used** from the details of how it is **constructed** from more primitive data objects. The interface between these two parts of our system will be a set of procedures, called *selectors* and *constructors*.

A procedural representation of pairs - message passing.

Church numerals - Alonzo Church.

## Section 2.2

### Closure property

An *operation for combining data objects* satisfies the *closure property* if the results of combining things with that *operation* can themselves be combined using the same *operation*.

A *set of elements* is said to be *closed under an operation* if applying the *operation* to elements in the set produces an element that is again an element of the set. 

### Sequences as *conventional interfaces*

One procedure's output is another's input. Similarly to signal flow in signal-processing, sequence flows through procedures.

### Nested mappings

The sequence paradigm is extended to include many computations that are commonly expressed using nested loops.

### *Metalinguistic abstraction* - a picture language
