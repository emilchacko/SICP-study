## Section 2.1

### Data abstraction

A methodology that enables us to isolate how a *compound data object* is **used** from the details of how it is **constructed** from more primitive data objects. The interface between these two parts of our system will be a set of procedures, called *selectors* and *constructors*.

A procedural representation of pairs - message passing.
